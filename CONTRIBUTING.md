### Please follow [GitHub Flow][gh-flow] for contributions:

1. The `master` branch is always stable and deployable.
1. To work on something new, create a new branch off `master`. Give it a descriptive name (e.g.: `new-user-sign-up`).
1. Commit early and often to your local branch. Regularly push your work to the same named branch on GitHub.
1. Open a pull request as soon as possible. Use the pull request to discuss your code and gain feedback.
